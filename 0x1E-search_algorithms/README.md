# Repository: 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

This repository contains solutions to various search algorithms implemented in C. The project focuses on understanding and implementing fundamental search algorithms such as linear search and binary search, as well as exploring the concept of Big O notation.

## Tasks

1. Linear search
2. Binary search
3. Big O #0
4. Big O #1
5. Big O #2
6. Big O #3
7. Big O #4

## Contents

- `0-linear.c`: Implementation of the linear search algorithm.
- `1-binary.c`: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
- `2-O`: Big O notation.
- `3-O`: Big O notation.
- `4-O`: Big O notation.
- `5-O`: Final Big O notation.
